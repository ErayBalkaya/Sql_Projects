Library management systems are essential components that form the foundation of modern libraries, enabling the effective management of library resources. These systems automate processes such as recording, 
cataloging, lending, and returning books, reducing the workload of library staff while facilitating user access to books. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool used in database management for library 
management systems. This study will focus on an Entity-Relationship Diagram (EDA) analysis of the database design and implementation of a library management system. The aim of this study is to enhance the efficiency 
of library services and improve the user experience.

## Descriptions of Tables:

### book : 
The table has three columns: "book_id" column is id for books, "title" as names of the books, and "publishername" as company names of the publishers.
### book_authors :
The table has three columns: "author_id" column is id for authors,"book_id" and "author_name".
### book_copies :
The table has four columns: "copies_id" column is id for copies,"book_id" , "branch_id" as id for each brand and "no_of_copies" as the amount of the copies.
### book_loans :
The table has six columns: "loans_id" column is id for loans,"book_id" , "branch_id" ,"card_no" as the card number of the member,"date_out" and "due_date".
### borrower :
The table has four columns: "card_no","name" as the name of the borrower , "address" is the address of the borrower and "phone" is for the phone number of the borrower.
### library_branch :
The table has three columns: "branch_id" column is id for branches,"branch_name" shows the names of the branches,"branch_address" shows the addresses of the branches.
### publisher :
The table has three columns: "name" column is names of the publishers,"address" as the locations of publishers , "phone" column is for the phone numbers of publishers.

## Case Study Questions:

1)How many copies of the book titled "The Lost Tribe" are owned by the library branch whose name is "Sharpstown"? 

2)How many copies of the book titled "The Lost Tribe" are owned by each library branch?

3)For each book that is loaned out from the "Sharpstown" branch and whose DueDate is before 2018-03-01 , retrieve the book title, the borrower's name, and the borrower's address.

4)For each library branch, retrieve the branch name and the total number of books loaned out from that branch

5)Retrieve the names, addresses, and number of books checked out for all borrowers who have more than 6 books checked out.

6)For each book authored by "Stephen King", retrieve the title and the number of copies owned by the library branch whose name is "Central".

7)Which three books have been borrowed the most across all branches?

8)Which branch has the highest and lowest average number of books borrowed per borrower?

9)What is the distribution of books among different publishers? Which publisher has the highest number of books loaned?

10)What is the average number of books borrowed per borrower across all branches?

11)What is the distribution of book copies across different branches?

12)Which borrower has borrowed the most number of books?

13)Among the top five publishers with the most books loaned, which one has the highest average number of copies per book across all branches?
